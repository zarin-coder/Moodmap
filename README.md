# Moodmap
Interactive AI platform mapping and visualizing moods from social media and environmental data. Final project for the Building AI course.
![Moodmap Example](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png?text=Moodmap+Visualization)

## Data sources and AI methods
Moodmap depends on:
* Social media APIs (Twitter, Reddit, Instagram public posts)
* Environmental datasets (weather, public events, holidays)
* Optional user surveys

AI techniques used:
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis
* Data clustering and dimensionality reduction for pattern recognition
* Interactive mapping with visualization libraries (Plotly, Folium, or Leaflet)

## Challenges
Moodmap does not solve:
* Privacy concerns entirely — anonymization is applied, but risks remain.
* Perfect sentiment classification — sarcasm, slang, and mixed emotions are hard to detect.
* Comprehensive coverage — relies on available public posts and may have regional bias.

## What next
Future improvements could include:
* Adding multilingual support for broader datasets.
* Real-time live updates for dynamic mood tracking.
* Integration with mental health resources to offer help where negative trends are detected.
* Gamified community engagement to encourage contributions.
